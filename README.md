Thanks to Anthropic for making Claude freely available (sonnet 4 at the the date I created this repo as the nearly perfect result of my
request);

# Model Manager
I finally got sick and tired of looking at the model manifests for what blobs to copy from a PC's ollama setup
to another. Being a bit lazy, though, I asked Claude for such an utility (let me know if you want me to share the
details); TL;DR: two iterations were enough for it to come up with the working version I'm sharing.
Enjoy and, if you decide on improving it, let us know. These were the most productive 20'ish minutes with claude since
I first started "seriously" using it for idea/proof of concept about year ago (and yes, I've had many arguments with many
of its previous iterations :> )

# Usage
Point a panel to a 'models' folder and it will parse the manifests and show all the models and versions.
Point the other panel to another models folder, select a model node and use the 'copy' buttons to copy the selected
respective files.
As a bonus, it allows us to see what blobs belong to what model without going to the /api/tags endpoint.

Enjoy!
